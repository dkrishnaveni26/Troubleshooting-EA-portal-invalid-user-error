### Tips for best results:

- Tomato is one of the key ingredients, so ensure to use red, ripe, and firm tomatoes.
- We can always use fresh store-bought paneer, but, for best flavour and taste it is recommended to use homemade paneer. You can use [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9bwHBikW8o) as reference[^2] for preparing homemade paneer.
- Paneer cubes can be fried and added to the curry for extra crispness. 
- It is recommended to use Kashmiri chilli powder for bright orangish-red colour, apart from this ripe red tomatoes also contribute towards lovely orangish-red colour.
- Due to shortage of time if Cashews cannot be pre-soaked in water, we can replace it with finely powdered Cashews and add it when blending Tomato and Onion.
